# Accident Severity Prediction – Neural Network Classifier (CIS 412)

This project uses a neural network to classify accident severity levels based on various factors. Developed as part of Software Lab 4 in CIS 412 – Business Machine Learning at Arizona State University.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras or Scikit-learn (depending on notebook code)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Loaded and processed `accidentsnn.csv`, addressing missing values and encoding features.
- Designed and trained a **neural network classifier** to predict accident outcomes.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrix.
- Visualized training metrics to assess model learning and improvement.
